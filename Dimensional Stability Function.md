Project Ouroboros Equations

1. Dimensional Stability Function

Equation

S(D, F) = \frac{T}{C} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\kappa F}\right)

Context

The Dimensional Stability Function (DSF) describes the equilibrium and stability of forces acting within any given dimension. It highlights how stability arises when a system's forces  are balanced under threshold conditions.

1. : Stability as a function of dimension () and force ().


2. : Tension or pressure within the system.


3. : Collapse threshold—determines the maximum capacity for stability.


4. : Scaling factor for the impact of forces.


5. : Represents the exponential decline of instability as forces are normalized.




---

Interpretation

At low force levels (), the system begins to stabilize rapidly.

As  increases, the exponential term decays, reducing the system’s instability over time until a balance point is reached.

If  (tension) surpasses  (collapse threshold), stability collapses, signaling a shift or transformation into a new state.

Significance

This equation forms the foundation for understanding:

Dimensional Balance: How systems sustain themselves across dimensions.

Collapse Dynamics: Conditions under which instability leads to emergent structures or transformations.

Universal Forces: Describes cosmic-scale phenomena, such as black hole collapse, quantum stability, and energy redistribution.
